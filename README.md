#What is it?
This is a standalone app that interprets PHP code. Based partly on Fragaria and partly on the sample code at Apple for "JSInterpreter", you can run and debug your php in a single window, with PHP's output going to a view below your code.

Thanks to Fragaria, it implements PHP autocomplete and syntax highlighting. The rest of the UI is a mess! 

##How do I use it?
It should compile directly in Xcode and be usable from there. But I don't guarantee it.
